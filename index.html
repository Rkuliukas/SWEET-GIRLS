  <li>1 1/2 cups (300g) caster sugar (or fine white granulated sugar)</li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cooking oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon (10g) unsweetened cocoa powder plus 1 tablespoon extra for dusting</li>
  <li>2 1/2 tablespoons (45ml) red food colouring (liquid, not gel)</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) pure vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon (20ml) white vinegar</li>
  <li>2 1/2 cups (350g) plain cake flour, sifted (or all purpose/plain flour)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon baking soda (bi-carb soda)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 cup (250ml) buttermilk*</li>
  <li>Cream Cheese Frosting:</li>
  <li>14 ounces (400g) cream cheese (not spreadable), at room temperature</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (120g) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
  <li>4 cups confectioners (or icing) sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional -- adds subtle hint of lemon)</li>

</ul>


<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>For Cake:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Heat oven to 350°F | 175°C. Lightly grease two 8-inch cake pans with butter or nonstick oil spray and lightly dust with 1 tablespoon of the sifted cocoa powder.</li>
  <li>Cream butter and sugar together until light in colour. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition to combine well.</li>
  <li>In a smaller bowl, mix together oil, remaining cocoa powder, red food colouring and vanilla until smooth. Stir colour mixture and vinegar through the creamed sugar mixture to combine.</li>
  <li>Sift together flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Add half of the dry ingredients and half of the buttermilk to the wet ingredients; mix well. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients and buttermilk.</li>
  <li>Divide batter among the 2 prepared pans and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack completely.</li>
</ol>


<h3>For Cream Cheese Frosting:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Beat together cream cheese, butter and vanilla until smooth lighter in colour (about 3-4 minutes). Beat in icing sugar until frosting is light and fluffy (if frosting is too thin, add more icing sugar and beat again until reaching your desired consistency).<p>Optional if using: mix in the lemon juice</p></li>
</ol>





<h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Transfer 1 cake onto a serving dish/plate, flat-side down. Trim the top dome off of the cake to create a flat bottom later. Scoop about 1 1/2 - 2 cups of frosting onto cake and spread evenly over the top.</li>
  <li>Place second cake layer on top and use remaining frosting to cover top and sides of cake</li>
  <li>Crumble trimmed pieces of cake to decorate. <p>Enjoy!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>*To make your own buttermilk, mix 1 cup of full cream milk with 1 teaspoon vinegar before baking. Allow the milk to sour for 5-10 minutes.
