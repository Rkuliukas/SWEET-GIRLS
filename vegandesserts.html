  <p>This is because I think it's great that nowadays all people are able to enjoy the deliciousness of a great dessert, even if they can't eat dairy products or have other dietary requirements.

    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup vegan butter, room temperature</li>
    <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup champagne or prosecco, room temperature</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><b>Champagne Raspberry Buttercream:</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup vegan butter, room temperature</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons pureed raspberries</li>
    <li>5 cups icing sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup champagne or prosecco</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <p>Preheat oven to 175 degrees celcius and line muffin pans with cupcake liners. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
In bowl, beat the butter and sugar for 4 minutes with spoon until light and fluffy, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add the vanilla extract and mix again.
Gradually add the dry ingredients and the champagne, alternating, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to over mix. Scrape down sides of bowl as necessary.
Fill cupcake liners 2/3 full with batter. Bake for 18 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Don't overbake as they will continue to bake in the pan once removed! Let cupcakes cool in pans for 5 minutes, then remove to wire racks to finish cooling. Once cupcake are completely cool, frost with Raspberry icing.</p>
